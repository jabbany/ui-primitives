# ui-primitives

> Unopinionated vanilla components for building custom UI experiences.

`ui-primitives` is a set of implementations for common UI components written
in vanilla JavaScript (ES5).

It's targeted to assist developers writing vanilla JavaScript by implementing
a set of easy to use primitives for building custom UIs. As such, our code takes
the "include and run" approach to modularization and presents modules as UMD
loaders.

## Using `ui-primitives`

We recommend including `ui-primitives` directly in your code via:

````HTML
  <script type="text/javascript" src=""></script>
````

## Including CSS
